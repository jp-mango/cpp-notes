# C++ Notes and Learning Resources

Welcome to my repository of C++ notes and learning resources! This repository is a collection of materials, examples, and personal notes gathered throughout my journey of learning C++. It serves as a convenient place for me to store and organize everything I've learned about this powerful programming language.

## About C++

C++ is a high-performance language that offers a unique blend of procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms. It's widely used for system/software development, game development, real-time systems, and applications requiring high performance.
